# lempelziv-testing
Implementation of Lempel-Ziv Complexity metric and tests to check interpretability.

The LempelZiv Complexity computation (`lzc_comp.py`) is implemented. In addition, different binarization methods are implemented to apply to 1D signals, where an illustration of these is also shown (`main_binarization_methods.py`). Finally, the interpretability tests (`main_lzc_test.py`) exposed in [1] and in other investigations are replicated.
